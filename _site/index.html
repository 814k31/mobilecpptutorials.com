<p>MobileCPPTutorials.com began in August 2015 as a WordPress site with tutorials on how to build cross-platform iPhone and Android apps utilizing Dropbox’s Djinni tool. It quickly became apparent that the tools and development environment involved were involved were evolving too fast for me alone to keep up with. Therefore, MobileCPPTutorials.com version 2.0 has been reinvented as a collaborative GitHub-hosted site that the community can submit updates to, or even add additional tutorials.</p>
